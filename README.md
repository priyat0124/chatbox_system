🧠 AI Health Support Therapist – Chatbot System
Short Explanation & Working
🔹 What is the System?

“My project is a software-based AI Health Support Therapist chatbot that provides first-level mental health support through text, voice, and video interactions.
It analyzes the user’s emotional state using trained AI models and responds with empathetic messages, audio guidance, and motivational content.”

🔹 How the Chatbot Works (Step-by-Step)

“First, the user interacts with the chatbot using text, voice, or video.

1️⃣ The system collects user input.
2️⃣ The input is passed to an emotion detection model:

Text → LSTM-based emotion classification

Voice → Speech-to-text + emotion analysis

Video → Face detection and emotion recognition

3️⃣ Based on the detected emotion, the chatbot:

Generates a supportive response

Suggests coping strategies

Plays motivational audio or video

Stores emotion data for mood tracking

4️⃣ The chatbot continuously updates a mood graph, helping users understand their emotional patterns over time.”
